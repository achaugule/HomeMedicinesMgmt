<div id="search-component">
    <label for="search-box">Medicine </label>
    <input #searchBox id="search-box" (input)="search(searchBox.value)" />
  
    <ul class="search-result">

  </div>

  <!-- Notice that the *ngFor iterates over a list called heroes$, not heroes. 
        The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array. -->

        <!-- Since *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable, use the pipe character (|) followed by async. 
        This identifies Angular's AsyncPipe and subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class. -->
